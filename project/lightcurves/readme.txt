Lightcurves used in the Teachey & Kipping (2018) analysis.
The final moon analysis used the Kepler file kepler/AVG_SAP.dat,
which is the method-marginalized light curve of the SAP curves,
as well as wfc3_kepler1625/white.dat.

See the ../rotated_image/ folder for the pixel files used to
create the WFC3 lightcurves. The apertures used were

white:     456≤i≤581 & 526≤j≤542
blue:      476≤i≤518 & 526≤j≤542
red:       519≤i≤561 & 526≤j≤542
channel1:  456≤i≤468 & 526≤j≤542
channel2:  469≤i≤480 & 526≤j≤542
channel3:  481≤i≤493 & 526≤j≤542
channel4:  494≤i≤505 & 526≤j≤542

white (KIC 4760469): 439≤i≤568 & 583≤j≤590

white (blend star): 436≤i≤561 & 535≤j≤540
[this was used to estimate variability of the v faint WFC3 blend,
note that this is a previously uncataloged source]
